CS-255 Week 8 Requirement

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
This project was for DriverPass, a driving lesson company, to create a platform that would allow them to schedule appointments and maintain curricula for driving lessons. The system allows customers to maintain their own appointments, provides an interface for customers to take lessons online, and for drivers to input notes resulting from in-person lessons. The system also allows for communication and compliance with the local DMV.

# What did you do particularly well?
I think I did a good job understanding the requirements for the DriverPass system. It's very clear what the system needs to do, and I think I had a good idea of what that system should look like (inside and out).

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would put more detail into all of the diagrams. I made it no secret during my discussion posts that I do not like diagrams/graphs, I like bullet points and tables. I definitely lost some points during this class for not putting enough effort into these designs.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The initial interview with Liam at DriverPass gave me all the information I needed to design the DriverPass system. Interacting with the clients is one of the most important things we can do when designing a system. How could we possibly know it's going to work for them if we don't truly understnad the problem they're trying to solve, and whether or not we solved it correctly without their feedback?

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I always start very generally with a customer when gathering requirements. A couple specific things I like to know: 1. what does the client have now? and 2. what are some of the daily tasks the client needs to do? I always work iteratively - at my job, I am implementing an ERP software, so the top levels of my outline are always the module names (Accounts Receivable, Customer Orders, Purchasing, etc.). The outlines become more granular until a certain point - from there I'll make bullet-pointed workflows or sometimes sectioned documents with screenshots if the process is more complex. These documents are generally reviewed by the users to make sure they explain the process properly and completely, and are then forwarded to the company who develops our ERP.
